SPOTIFY CLONE
A Spotify clone is a simplified version of the popular music streaming service, Spotify. 
This project involves creating a basic web application where users can browse a library of songs, create playlists, and listen to music. 
The clone typically features a clean user interface with navigation options for Home, Library, Search, and Profile. 
It includes basic player controls like play, pause, next, and previous, along with album art and song details. 
The project is built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
